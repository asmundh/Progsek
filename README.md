# Simple python web application

Python webpy application running on uswgi server with nginx using docker connected to another docker-runned mysql database.

Web Server image: https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-docker
webpy framework: http://webpy.org/


## Prerequisites:

Docker https://www.docker.com/

IMPORTANT Windows users use:
> git clone <repositoryURL> --config core.autocrlf=input

On linux docker is started with

$ sudo systemctl start docker

To run docker-compose without sudo the user must be added to the usergroup:

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

## Run

$ docker-compose up

### Build / Rebuild

Upon changes in the code the docker image must be built again for the changes to take effect. Some changes might not get reflected even on build, which is when the --force-recreate attribute can be used.

$ docker-compose up --build --force-recreate

### Prune / Recreate
If you need a completely fresh rebuild (WARNING this will remove all your docker images). This will reset the images including the database which is not necessary affected by only rebuilding the images

$ docker system prune -a

$ docker-compose up

# Deploy locally

Running the application outside of containers might be useful for development because the images does not need to be rebuilt for every change in the code.

## Prerequisites:

mysql

python 3.6.8 or higher

src/app/requirements.txt

## Run Datatbase:

Launch mysql at default port (3306)

$ systemctl start mysqld

Log in to database

$ sudo mysql -u root

Insert mysql queries:

CREATE database db;

USE db;

SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('root');

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db.* TO 'root'@'localhost';


Then populate databse by posting mysql/sql/init.sql into mysql


## Run app

Edit src/app/models/database.py to point at local database server

$ cd src/app/

$ python3 src/app/main.py

# Config

The ip and ports for the web server and database is set with the .env file using the groupid variable.
